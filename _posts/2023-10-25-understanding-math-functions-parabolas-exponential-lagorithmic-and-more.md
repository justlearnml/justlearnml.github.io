In this discussion about algebra, we'll explore the world of mathematical functions and how they transform. Our focus will be on parabolas, exponentials, logarithms, square roots, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas, all with a view to simplify algebra and math.

## Parabola

The main form of parabola is represented as $$y = ax^2 + bx + c$$

**Horizontal translation:** The graph shifts horizontally if the equation is in the form of $$y = (x - h)^2$$.
The graph moves to the right if $$h > 0$$, and to the left if $$h < 0$$.

**Vertical translation:** The graph shifts vertically if the equation is in the form of $$y = x^2 + k$$.
The graph moves up if $$k > 0$$, and down if $$k < 0$$.

**Reflection** The graph is reflected over the x-axis (upside down) when the coefficient of $$x^2$$ which is $$a$$ is negative.

## Exponential Function

The main form of exponential is represented as $$y = Ab^x$$ where $$b > 0$$ and $$b \neq 1$$

**Horizontal translation:** The graph shifts horizontally if the equation is in the form of $$y = Ab^{(x - h)}$$.
The graph moves to the right if $$h > 0$$, and to the left if $$h < 0$$.

**Vertical translation:** The graph shifts vertically if the equation is in the form of $$y = Ab^{x} + k$$.
The graph moves up if $$k > 0$$, and down if $$k < 0$$.

**Reflection:**

The graph is reflected over the x-axis (upside down) the coefficient of $$b^x$$ which is $$A$$ is negative.

The graph is reflected over the y-axis when the coefficient of $$x$$ itself is negative.

## Logarithmic Function

The main form of exponential is represented as $$y = log_b(x)$$

**Horizontal translation:** The graph shifts horizontally if the equation is in the form of $$y = log_b(x - h)$$.
The graph moves to the right if $$h > 0$$, and to the left if $$h < 0$$.

**Vertical translation:** The graph shifts vertically if the equation is in the form of $$y = log_b(x) + k$$.
The graph moves up if $$k > 0$$, and down if $$k < 0$$.

## Square Root Function

The main form of square root function is represented as $$y = \sqrt{x}$$

**Horizontal translation:** The graph shifts horizontally if the equation is in the form of $$y = \sqrt{x - h}$$.
The graph moves to the right if $$h > 0$$, and to the left if $$h < 0$$.

**Vertical translation:** The graph shifts vertically if the equation is in the form of $$y = \sqrt{x} + k$$.
The graph moves up if $$k > 0$$, and down if $$k < 0$$.

**Reflection:**

## Circles

The main form of a circle function is represented as $$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$$ where
- $$h$$ is the x-coordinate of the center,
- $$k$$ is the y-coordinate of the center,
- $$r$$ is the radius of the circle.

**Horizontal and vertical translation:**
The graph moves to the right if $$h > 0$$, and to the left if $$h < 0$$.
The graph moves up if $$k > 0$$, and down if $$k < 0$$.

The main form of an ellipse function is represented as $$\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$ where
- $$h$$ is the x-coordinate of the center,
- $$k$$ is the y-coordinate of the center,
- $$a$$ is the length from the center of the ellipse to the edge of the ellipse along the x-axis,
- $$b$$ is the length from the center of the ellipse to the edge of the ellipse along the y-axis.

**Horizontal and vertical translation:**
The graph moves to the right if $$h > 0$$, and to the left if $$h < 0$$.
The graph moves up if $$k > 0$$, and down if $$k < 0$$.

## Hyberbola
The main form of a hyberbola function is represented as $$\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$ or $$-\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$ where

$$y = \frac{bx}{a} + (k - \frac{bh}{a})$$ and $$y = -\frac{bx}{a} + (k + \frac{bh}{a})$$ are its asymptotes.

Asymptotes are lines that hyberbola gets closer and closer to but never actually touches them as x increses or decreases.

In the equations:
- $$(h, k)$$ is the coordinate of the intersection of asymptotes,
- $$(h \pm a, k)$$ are the coordinates of the vertices of hyberla in the form of $$\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$,
- $$(h, k \pm b)$$ are the coordinates of the vertices of hyberla in the form of $$-\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$.
