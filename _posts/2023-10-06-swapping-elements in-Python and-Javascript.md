metaDescription: Swap elements in Python and JavaScript without extra variables. Quick and easy method.

I recently discovered a simple way to swap elements in Python and Javascript without needing a `temp` variable.

In Python:

```python
    a = 1
    b = 2
    a, b = b, a
```

In Javascript:

```javascript
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    [a, b] = [b, a];
```

That's it! Easy and effective.
